	<h2> A Brief Word from the Website Creator </h2>
	<div id="brief">
		<div id="repeated">
			<p> Hi! As Lee's Best Man, I insisted on helping the happy couple by spending a few minutes putting this website together for a very reasonable fee. You're welcome guys! <span id="error">/Coderror/</span> </p>
			<p> People often say to me: "You're a successful, popular and athletic problem-solver with 12 years of professional experience; and now you've taught yourself to build cutting-edge websites?! </div> Are your new skills a sign of a change in career direction?
			</p> 
		<p> To which I usually respond: "That's a great question, Mum. My instinct tells me that technology such as the World Wide Web is a growth sector of the future. I'm happy where I am right now - but if the right offer came along, I would consider it in a flash. To potential employers or recruiters, I say 'Yes, I'm in demand, but let's see what you have to offer, so please, <strong> <i> please </i> </strong> get in touch using the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/08mOIZp5086A1cuB3"> RSVP </a> link'" </p>

	<div id="instructed">
		<strong>**</strong> I have been instructed by Sophia's lawyers to add that wedding invitees can also use this site for <a href="index.html#details"> details </a> and to <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/08mOIZp5086A1cuB3"> RSVP </a><strong>**</strong>
